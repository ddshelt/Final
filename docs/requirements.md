#Final Ideas

##Project Obectives
- create a new way for people to share, like, and comment on music
- to help Hip Hop fans weed out quality projects
- display the top 5 most listened to albums (current)
- rate quality of albums/songs
- keep users engaged with site by updating the site with the
  latest music, videos, memes, and gossip.

## Users

- Fans of Hip Hop
- Twitter & Tumblr users
- Internet users from the ages of 16 and up
- Music Execs
- A&Rs
- Entertainment Managers
- Music Labels
- Music Lovers

## Problems

- No problems will be fixed, but I believe by bringing everything deemed as
  "cool" to one website where hipsters and culture vultures alike can go
  and discuss issues, music, and trends going on in Hip Hop and Pop culture
  would be a great avenue for self-expression for generations to come.

##You would be able to:\
  - be updated on whats new, and see your friends' opinions on trending issues,
    fashion statements, and mainstream/underground music
  - like, comment, and follow other users' profiles to network and gain new perspective
    on the latest trends
  - Share ideas, events, and new music
  - choose to create a Listener, Artist, or Executive profile
  - personalize your profile with your Top 5 favorite Albums/Songs
  - interact with other users using messaging system or through commenting on posts
  - follow your favorite artists to be notified of anything posted to any of their
    social media accounts, Twitch, or Youtube.
